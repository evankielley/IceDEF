    "The drift model produced by Turnbull et. al.

(2017). However, the timescale of drifting was $2.5 - 113.5$ hours (versus the aforementioned Wagner models timescale of $1$ year) so for that reason, among others, the final equation of motion for this model differs significantly from that of the Wagner model. \\\\\n",
