    Notes:
        All units are ANSI. Specifically, velocities are in meters per second, positions are in degrees latitude or 
        longitude, size dimensions are in meters, masses are in kilograms, times are in seconds, and forces are in Newtons.
    
    Args:
        iceberg (obj): Contains variables that describe the iceberg's velocity, position, size dimensions, and mass.
        UA (float): U-component of air velocity.
        VA (float): V-component of air velocity.
        UW (float): U-component of water velocity.
        VW (float): V-component of water velocity.
        dt (float): Timestep size.
        
    Returns:
        Vx_new (float): New x-component of iceberg velocity
        Vy_new (float): New y-component of iceberg velocity
        x_new (float): New x-component of iceberg position.
        y_new (float): New y-component of iceberg position.
