\section{Introduction}

    In regards to the analytical iceberg drift model created by Till
Wagner in 2016, the naive evaluations of complicated expressions 
and the use of single precision input data causes inaccurate results. 
This document shows how we fixed this problem by doing two things: 
one, changing the input data into double precision; two, doing Taylor 
expansions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for further evaluation using 
Horner's rule.
    
\section{Improvements to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Functions}
The functions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are defined in Dr. Wagner's paper
as:

    \begin{equation}
        \alpha \equiv \frac{1}{2\Lambda^3}(1-\sqrt{1+4\Lambda^4})
    \end{equation} 

    \begin{equation}
        \beta \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\Lambda^3}[(1+\Lambda^4)
        \sqrt{1+4\Lambda^4} -3\Lambda^4-1]^{1/2}
    \end{equation}

where $\Lambda$ is some constant that is occasionally very small (but
never negative). Hence the problem herein comes from computing the 
following differences:

    \begin{equation}
        1 - \sqrt{1+\Lambda^4}
    \end{equation}

for $\alpha$ and:

    \begin{equation}
       (1+\Lambda^4)\sqrt{1+4\Lambda^4} -3\Lambda^4-1
    \end{equation}

% insert beta plot between 0 and 1

for $\beta$ -- as $\Lambda$ approaches zero. This is due to round-off 
errors.

To fix this issue, we began by taking the Taylor approximation for 
$\alpha$:

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(-u+\frac{u^5}{4}-\frac{u^9}{8}+
        \frac{5u^{13}}{64}-\frac{7u^{17}}{128}+O(u^{21}))
    \end{equation}

and for $\beta$:

    \begin{multline}
        \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}(u^3-\frac{3u^7}{8}+\frac{27u^{11}}{128}-
        \frac{143u^{15}}{1024}+\frac{3315u^{19}}{32768} - 
        \frac{20349u^{23}}{262144}+ \frac{260015u^{27}}{4194304} - \\ 
        \frac{1710855u^{31}}{33554432} + 
        \frac{92116035u^{35}}{2147483648} - 
        \frac{744762895u^{39}}{17179869184} + O(u^{43}))
    \end{multline}

where the new equation for $\alpha$ contains less terms than the new
equation for $\beta$ because $\beta$ is more ill-conditioned.

In order to avoid computing large exponents of $u$ we simplified each
new equation using Horner's rule. Therefore $\alpha$ then became:

    \begin{multline}
        u(u^4(u^4(u^4(-0.0386699020961393u^4 + 0.055242717280199) - \\ 
        0.0883883476483184) + 0.176776695296637) - 0.707106781186548)
    \end{multline}

and $\beta$ became:

    \begin{multline}
        u^3(u^4(u^4(u^4(u^4(u^4(u^4(u^4(u^4(u^4(-0.0138698305427678u^4 + \\
        0.0129890788831978) - 0.0151656272365985) + \\ 
        0.0180267866272764) + 0.0219176256311202) - \\
        0.0274446790511418) + 0.0357675015202851) - \\
        0.0493731785691779) + 0.0745776683282687) - \\
        0.132582521472478) + 0.353553390593274)
    \end{multline}

which is beneficial because the largest power of $u$ that must be 
computed is the fourth power.

\section{Single vs. Double Precision Input Data}
In Dr. Wagner's model, the input data for sea surface temperature is in
single precision. By simply changing the importation of this data into
double precision we solved the problem of errors occurring at the 
epsilon for single precision by making the errors occur at the epsilon
for double precision.
